This project was made by Richard Cruz-Silva. The idea for DrivewayStay is to create an app 
that connect people (owners) with parking spaces near locations such as stadiums and venues with 
people (renters) travelling wanting to avoid expensive parking fees and large traffic around those
venues.

There will be a separate owner login from the renter login. Owners will be able to post their
address as well as how many spots and what the availibilty of them will be. Renters will
be able to add vehicles to their profile and reserve dates from owner spots.

I tried to add simplecov to my original project but ended up breaking it and it was never
able to load the simplecov file (cannot load such file -- simplecov) so I recreated the
project adding a "2" to everything so that explains why the project is called
drivewaystay2. I intend to fix my original project and get that working but I made this
new project in order to submit something that works.

I have been working on this project for about a week after I was removed from my group
project due to miscommunication so I have not gotten it to a state that I am proud of yet.

The website is still very primative and the register new owner/renter does not work on
heroku even though it works in my dev environment. I intend to add much more functionality
like adding vehicles to renters and creting a reservation system for owners and renters.
